# Virtual File System 📁💻

The Virtual File System is a Go project that provides a virtual file system capable of storing and managing files in a single file or database. It includes functionalities such as file compression, encryption, versioning, and caching.

## Project Structure 📂

The project follows the following structure:


- The `cmd` directory contains the main entry point of the project, `main.go`, where the command-line interface (CLI) is implemented.
- The `database` directory includes the code responsible for interacting with the database (MongoDB in this case).
- The `filesystem` directory contains the main logic of the virtual file system, including file operations, compression, encryption, caching, etc.
- The `README.md` file contains documentation and usage examples.

## Dependencies 🛠️

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Go (version 1.16 or higher) 🐹
- MongoDB (ensure it is installed and running) 🍃

Additionally, you need to install the following Go packages:


## Installation ⚙️

To install and run the Virtual File System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-file-system.git


2. Change into the project directory:
cd virtual-file-system



3. Build the project:
go build ./cmd/main.go



4. Run the project:
./main



## Usage 🚀

The Virtual File System CLI provides the following commands:

- `create <file-name>`: Create a new file in the virtual file system.
- `read <file-name>`: Read the content of a file from the virtual file system.
- `write <file-name> <content>`: Write content to a file in the virtual file system.
- `delete <file-name>`: Delete a file from the virtual file system.
- `compress <file-name>`: Compress a file in the virtual file system.
- `encrypt <file-name>`: Encrypt a file in the virtual file system.
- `version <file-name>`: Get the version history of a file in the virtual file system.

Here are some usage examples:

- Create a new file:
./main create myfile.txt


- Write content to a file:
./main write myfile.txt "Hello, World!"


- Read the content of a file:
./main read myfile.txt


- Delete a file:
./main delete myfile.txt


- Compress a file:
./main compress myfile.txt


- Get the version history of a file:
./main version myfile.txt


Make sure to replace `./main` with the appropriate command based on your operating system.

Remember to provide the necessary arguments as described in the command usage.
