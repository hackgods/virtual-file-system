# Virtual File System 📁💻

The Virtual File System is a Go project that provides a virtual file system capable of storing and managing files in a single file or database. It includes functionalities such as file compression, encryption, versioning, and caching.

## Features

✨ The file versioning system offers the following features:

1. **Add File Versions**: You can add new versions of a file along with the corresponding content, creation time, and modification time.

2. **Update Files**: Existing files can be updated with new content, automatically creating a new version with an incremented version number.

3. **Retrieve Latest Version**: You can easily retrieve the latest version of a file, allowing you to access the most up-to-date content.

4. **Compressed Storage**: The file content is stored in a compressed format, reducing storage space and improving efficiency.

## Technologies Used

🚀 The project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- Golang (Go): A powerful and efficient programming language for building scalable applications.
- MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
- Gzip: A compression algorithm used to compress and decompress file content.

## Getting Started

👨‍💻 To get started with the file versioning system, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Go and MongoDB installed on your machine.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/hackgods/virtual-file-system.git

3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running:
go mod download

4. **Configure MongoDB**: Update the MongoDB connection details.

5. **Build the Application**: Build the application by running the following command:
go build

6. **Run the Application**: Start the file versioning system by running the following command:
./virtual-file-system


## Usage

🔧 Once the file versioning system is up and running, you can interact with it using the provided command-line interface (CLI). Here are some example commands:

- `signup` - Create a new account.
- `login` - Login to your account.
- `cd <directory>` - Change the current working directory.
- `pwd` - Print the current working directory.
- `mkdir <directory>` - Create a new directory.
- `rmdir <directory>` - Remove a directory.
- `ls` - List the files and directories in the current directory.
- `create <filename> <content>` - Create a new file
- `read <filename>` - Read the content of a file
- `update <filename> <content>` - Update the content of a file
- `delete <filename>` - Delete a file
- `compress <filename>` - Compress the content of a file
- `decompress <filename>` - Decompress the content of a file
- `encrypt <filename>` - Encrypt the content of a file
- `decrypt <filename>` - Decrypt the content of a file
- `cache <filename>` - Get the content of a file from cache
- `version <filename>` - Get the version details of a file
- `exit` - Exit the program
